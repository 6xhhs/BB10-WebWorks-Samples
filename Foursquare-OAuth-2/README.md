# Foursquare OAuth 2.0 Sample

This sample demonstrates how to integrate Foursquare and the OAuth 2.0 protocol into a BlackBerry WebWorks application for BlackBerry 10.

Foursquare OAuth Sample is the name of a proof-of-concept WebWorks application that allows a user to authenticate with Foursquare, search for near-by venues using HTML5 Geolocation, and check-in to a venue.

The sample code for this application is Open Source under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

## What's new?

As of WebWorks SDK 1.0.4.7 we now take advantage of the window.open support.  OAuth samples **no longer need to rely on a server-side component** to redirect the webview back to your application.  This provides a nice flowing user experience.

## Initial Foursquare Setup

Open app.js and edit the following object

```
// foursquare setup
foursquareOptions = {
   clientId: '',
   clientSecret: '',
   redirectUri: ''
};
```
## Config.xml 
As of BlackBerry WebWorks 1.0.2.9 SDK, all domains you plan on making Ajax/XHR requests to must be whitelisted in your app's config.xml.

**Note: While we need to disable web security in order to read the location of our childWindow object, it's recommended that you don't do this in your apps unless absolutely necessary.**

```
<access uri="*" subdomains="true" />

<feature id="blackberry.app" >
   <param name="websecurity" value="disable" />
</feature>
```
## Security Considerations
Your Client Secret key, is intended to stay SECRET.  For demonstration purposes we coded the Client ID and Client Secret right in the JavaScript source.  This is not best practice, and is not recommended.  You donâ€™t want anybody to get access to your keys.

One way to securely pass your Client Secret to your application is to host it on a server, then use SSL and do a POST to obtain your key. It can then be used to obtain an Access Token from the service (in this case, Foursquare).

## End Points

This sample app shows how to connect your application with a few different Foursquare end-points. The source code is fairly well commented, and will show the entire flow. The syntax is as follows:

### User grants app permission and Foursquare returns an OAuth access token

```
// open the authorzation url
var url = 'https://foursquare.com/oauth2/authenticate?client_id=' + foursquareOptions.clientId + '&response_type=token&display=touch&redirect_uri=' + foursquareOptions.redirectUri;
childWindow = window.open(url, '_blank');
```
### Search for near-by venues
		
```
var url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?ll=' + lat + ',' + lon + '&oauth_token=' + accessToken + '&v=' + currentDate;

$.ajax({
   type: 'GET',
   url: url,
   
   // success
   success: function(data) {
   },

   // fail
   error: function() {
   }
});
```

### Check-in to a venue

```
var url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/checkins/add?venueId=' + venueId + '&oauth_token=' + accessToken;

$.ajax({
   type: 'POST',
   url: url,

   // success
   success: function() {
   },

   // fail
   error: function(data) {
   }
});
```

## How to Build

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Use Using the Ripple Mobile Emulator and either the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphone or the BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS, package the contents of your local BB10-WebWorks-Samples/Foursquare-OAuth-2 folder into a BlackBerry application.

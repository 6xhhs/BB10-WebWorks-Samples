# Avatar-booth - example application for getUserMedia.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the getUserMedia functionality in BlackBerry 10 WebWorks. This allows access to the front and rear cameras on the device. The application let's you add a moustache and snap a photo, all within the Web Application.

The same code will work across other WebKit browser such as Chrome and Safari, without any changes to the code.

# Injection Sample

This sample code demonstrates how to inject the Blackberry Object into a website which is not an application. It gives you back control in JS where you
can then access APIs and use them as desired. The use case could be to wrap a website into an application, skinning it to look better and work with platform
features on BB10.

## Overview

1. Inside the ext folder is the custom extension. You need to copy it into your Framework subdirectory of your WebWorks Packager. Please re-name it something meaningful such as injector.
2. Modify the config.xml file to ensure you are pulling in the proper extension named inside your manifest.json file.
3. Move the contents of the app folder inside your application.
